        <h3>Are vaccines dangerous?</h3>
        <p>Like any medicine, immunizations can lead to a negative reaction. That's not surprising because every individual is different. Genetic variations, immune deficiencies and environmental exposures all contribute to how a person's body reacts to inoculations against disease.This makes vaccines dangerous.</p>
